// Description:
// Freeze time and adjust it to your preferred time.

// Configuration:
// Set this value to your desired time of day. The value must be in 24-hour format and in decimal. For example, if you want to set it to 9 PM, it would be 21.0. By default, it is set to 12 PM, noon.
var desiredTimeOfDay = 12.0;

// Walkthrough: 
// Intution: The current time of day is a value from 0.0 to 1.0
// Turns out this is correct. It resets at midnight from 1.0 to 0.0.
// Finding the value in CE is easy enough.
// CE scan for float bigger than 0
// CE continue scan for float less than 1
// CE continue scan for incresed value 
// continue until theres like 1200ish values, one will stick out from all the
// others (because all the others will be the same).
// When the time resets from 1 to 0 you can scan for that as well to be sure.
// Find what writes to the value.
// fstp dword ptr [eax+0Ch]
// Open this method in IDA and see that it is called 18 times.
// Thats 17 times too many for me to want to figure out the interesting calls.
// Since the function is small, we can replace it with something that just sets 
// [eax+0Ch] to our desired time of day.

// mov eax, [ecx] is from the original function. We move the hex representation
// of our floating point time of day (0.0 - 1.0) to eax+0Ch then return.

// times).
